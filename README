"nstream": the Proposed Networking addition to the ISO C++ STL...

"nstream" is short for network stream.
nstream will provide a stream-based uniform i/o networking interface similar to
the fstream template library in the C++ STL.
nstream will support datagram, stream, and raw sockets as well as IPC.

nstream is included with "#include <nstream>". From there, users can create one
of three stream objects: nstream, onstream, instream.
